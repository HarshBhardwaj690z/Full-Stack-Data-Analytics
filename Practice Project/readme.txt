This is a project Which I've treated as a practice project in which I've create alot of measures,columns and table which may or may not used in my Dashboard(I'm aware that it will make my dashboard slow but it is for practice)
I've used snowflake to create mastertable and connect it to powerBI and make a dashboard from that information.
